                            <p>I am Hrishikesh Ballal, welcome to my website. I have had this site in one form or the other for the past 25 years or so. Everyone calls me Hrishi, the H is silent so it is pronounced as ‘Reeshee’. My name, ऋषिकेश in Devanagari / Marathi has a Sanskrit origin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishikesh">Rishikesh</a> is also the name of a ancient city in the foothills of the Himalayas. This site provides Atom or RSS feeds and you can subscribe to them to get the latest. I am <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hrishiballal">@hrishiballal</a> on Twitter and also on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrishiballal">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com/hrishiballal/">Github</a> and my email address is at the bottom of this page.</p>
                            <p>I am Mechanical Engineer by training specializing in Engineering Design, Operations Research with degrees from University of Michigan and MIT. In 2015, I completed my PhD at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London with a focus on geodesign. My thesis was round early stage design and is entitled <a href="http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1471177/">Collaborative planning with digital design synthesis</a>.</p>
                            <p>I have built and work on three things: Geoforage.io, Geodesignhub.com and Openskies.sh. </p>
                            <p><a href="https://www.geoforage.io/">Geoforage.io</a> is a spatial data collection software primarily used in the context of public engagement. Using this tool you can understand local preferences and capture the knowledge how a space or location functions directly from citizens and other people who use it. In addition to enabling these “geo-surveys” we host your spatial data, analyze it and help you understand the location you are working on.</p>
                            <p><a href="https://www.geodesignhub.com/">Geodesignhub.com</a> is a pioneering software for mediation and negotiations about difficult social political problems around a space. In addition to enabling negotiations using our technology, we provide project organization and management support around implementation of the negotiated outcomes. It is used to solve some of the most complex and pressing problems of today.</p>
                            <p><a href="https://openskies.sh/">Openskies.sh</a> is a open source software company with a mission to support current and future aerial robotics ecosystem. Specifically, I work on Identity and Authentication, Aircraft Surveillance and API harmonization for unmanned aerial vehicals. I also work with different stakeholders as part of standards bodies and around technical aspects of aspects of regulation of unmanned aviation and its integration with national and international airspace.</p>
                            <p>My expertise and work in the “geo” domain has a strong mechanical / systems engineering focus. I have a long association with open source software a founding member the local chapter of OSGEO: <a ref="https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Ireland">OSGeo Ireland</a> and a huge advocate of open data for governance and public policy. I feel like I have had many lives professionally. I have written a huge amount of closed and open source software, worked in the automotive industry, United Nations, spent time in Japan, worked at Microsoft among other things. Prior to my “geo” focus, I was working as a regulatory expert on the hardware aspects of consumer electronics. It all started when I was offered a fellowship to work on solving the collection and end-of-life aspects of e-waste and it was the thesis for my <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/47866">degree</a>.</p>
